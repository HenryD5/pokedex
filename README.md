### Solution
```
- I used scss for its ease of syntax, variable declaration, file nesting, etc.
- I used bootstrap for some general web styling.
- I used vuex for state management, which helps with business logic.
- I made use of mixins to reuse code in the different components.
- I made use of single file components to modularize the styles for web scalability.

```
